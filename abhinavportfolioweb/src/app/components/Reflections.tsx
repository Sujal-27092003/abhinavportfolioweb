            These experiences expanded my understanding of education beyond the classroom. Training 
            facilitators deepened my belief in peer-led and community-rooted learning, while working with 
            the PPP Cell highlighted the importance of systems, accountability, and evidence-informed 
            decision-making. Engaging with data, reports, and multiple stakeholders helped me understand 
            the importance of accountability, monitoring, and alignment between policy intent and ground 
            realities. Together, they shaped my interest in learning design, program management, and 
            strengthening education at scale.
